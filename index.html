    <hr>
    <p> My name is John. I want to be very good in writing code.
    I am currently learning FullStack Development at CapacityBay.
    I belong to Sub Group Nile.<br> I can help you build a product , 
    feature or website Look through some of my work and experience! 
    If you like what you see and have a project you need <br>coded,
    donâ€™t hestiate to contact me. 
    
    <br>
    <br>These days it doesn't matter if you're part of a Fortune 500 organization 
    or a brand new startup,your knowledge of databases and your ability to improve <br>
    that knowledge is one of the most valuable and long lasting business skills you can have.
    And I stress it's a business skill because unlike many technologies, <br>
    what's most important here is not having specialized technical expertise that only applies to one
    particular product,instead  what's valuable is a generally accepted<br> set of concepts and approaches,
    that have been around for decades, can be learned quickly and then applied in multiple situations regardless
    of which vendor and <br>which database you have. And simply being able to ask more informed questions about
    databases can shape the success of your project, even the success of an entire <br>organization.
    So, in the next few minutes we will get clear on the most important ideas here. 
    We're going to cover the jargon, the terms and phrases you'll
    encounter <br>again and again, not just database,but a bunch of other data terms that come along for the 
    ride,like data analytics, big data, data warehousing, data modeling. We'll talk<br>
    about normalization, schemas.We'll go over relational versus non-relational, and more besides. Cover
    acronyms like SQL versus NoSQL versus NewSQL, and why<br> do some  people say S-Q-L and some people say 
    "sequel".
